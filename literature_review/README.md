# AI6121: Directed Reading and Literature Review

## Problem Overview

With the advance of deep learning, we have witnessed significant progress in a wide spectrum of computer vision techniques in image segmentation (e.g. semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), image classification, object detection (e.g. two-stage object detection, one-stage object detection, anchor-free object detection, few-shot object detection, etc.), image generation (e.g. image synthesis from noise, image composition, image-to-image translation, image editing). To address various challenges in these computer vision problems, we also witnessed the fast development of machine learning techniques in supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, weakly supervised learning, self-supervised learning, few-shot learning, unsupervised learning, transfer learning, unsupervised domain adaptation, etc.
This literature review aims to equip you with a good understanding of different computer vision and machine learning techniques. You are expected to select one of the above listed computer vision techniques or a different technique beyond the list, and produce a literature review report. The report should cover (but not limited to) the following points:

1. What is the selected technique about?
2. What are the typical technical approaches for the selected technique, and what are their pro and con?
3. What is the state of the art of the selected technique?
4. What are open challenges of the selected technique, and what are possible solutions in your view?
5. What are the future research trends of the selected technique?
6. Identify one most impressive paper about the selected technique, and elaborate what are the paperâ€™s major contributions and constraints, and why you think it is most impressive.

## Notes

After reviewing the submitted report, I realized my description on hard negatives in chapter 3 of page 9 may be incorrect.
